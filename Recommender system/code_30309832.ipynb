    "In this task, we are using implicit feedback to recommend a list of items to each user. We have 2174 items and 2239 users.User interaction data is given to us which has '1' if the user interacted with the item and '0' if the user did not interact. **Implicit feedbacks** are implied in the user actions. The underlying assumption is that **“if a user clicked/viewed/spent time on an item often, it is an indication of its preference for that item”**. Implicit feedback comes on many forms, **browsing, clicking, typing,...** whereas explicit feedback solely comes from some sort of ratings scale."

    "<p>node2vec is an algorithm to generate vector representations of nodes on a graph. The node2vec framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph through the use of random walks through a graph starting at a target node. It is useful for a variety of machine learning applications. Besides reducing the engineering effort, representations learned by the algorithm lead to greater predictive power.node2vec follows the intuition that random walks through a graph can be treated like sentences in a corpus. Each node in a graph is treated like an individual word, and a random walk is treated as a sentence. By feeding these \"sentences\" into a skip-gram, or by using the continuous bag of words model paths found by random walks can be treated as sentences, and traditional data-mining techniques for documents can be used.</p>"
